# ADR-0009: Backends and the context figure

## Context

The runtime has to run on whatever program runs the model: an API reached through a router, a CLI on
a subscription with its acting features switched off, a CLI that keeps its own conversation and may
run its own tools inside a turn. The loop knows none of this. This record fixes what a backend is,
what it hands back beside the text, what it keeps for whoever reads the spend, and the one number
the runtime derives from it: the context figure [[ADR-0006-the-notification|ADR-0006]] prints and
[[ADR-0003-the-bounds|ADR-0003]] bounds on.

The backend is the caller's argument to `run` ([[ADR-0001-the-actor|ADR-0001]]), called once per
turn ([[ADR-0002-the-run|ADR-0002]]); a native tool call in its answer is read back as text
([[ADR-0004-the-language|ADR-0004]]); the fold it must follow is [[ADR-0007-the-record|ADR-0007]].
Which model a name resolves to, through which route and on whose key, and whether the model that
answered is the one named, are decided below this boundary: here a backend is built with a model
name and answers with text. Source: `Backend`, `Reply` and the anchor in `lionagi/actor.py`;
`hub/harness/openrouter.py`, `hub/harness/claude_code.py`, `hub/harness/codex.py`.

## Definitions

- **backend**: a function from the view, as messages, to the model's text; the caller's argument to
  `run`. It acts on nothing.
- **call**: one invocation of the backend: one per turn, awaited when it is awaitable.
- **attempt**: one request a call sends; a call retries on a transient failure and answers from its
  last attempt.
- **prompt count**: the provider's own count of the prompt an attempt sent: fresh input, cache read
  and cache write together.
- **`Reply`**: the text a backend hands back with the prompt count of the attempt that answered, or
  none when the provider did not say.
- **envelope**: what a backend keeps per call beside the text: usage, cost, attempts, timing, the
  provider's finish reason; a failed call keeps one too.
- **session**: a CLI conversation a backend keeps across calls, one per run, each call sending only
  what the view gained.
- **floor**: the least a run's prompt count has stood above the view estimate sent with it: the
  backend's own fixed context, which no fold takes off.

## Assumptions

| A1 | A provider's prompt count is the size of the context the model saw on that attempt.                                               | the router's `usage.prompt_tokens`; the session CLI's input, cache read and cache write per turn; on 4,240 bench calls the count read 1.20 times the view estimate plus 1,695 ([[ADR-0006-the-notification#Assumptions\|ADR-0006/A3]]) | the anchor is exact about the wrong prompt; the figure returns to the estimate                        |
| A2 | A CLI with its acting features switched off is a chat completion.                                                                 | with the flags in `hub/harness/codex.py` the CLI cannot run a command, search or spawn, measured on its 0.153 release; the session CLI under `--tools ""` and one turn                                    | C1's CLI backends are agents, and their acts pass no gate ([[ADR-0005-command-handling\|ADR-0005]])   |
| A3 | What a count stands above the view at its least is fixed context; what it later stands above that is history the record never saw. | the session CLI reads 34k cached input per call with its settings loaded against 3.9k without; on a served run one call read 14.8M tokens over its tool turns while the estimate never moved (2026-09-24) | the fold fires every turn past a budget the fixed context exceeds, or never sees the tool turns       |

## Claims

### C1: A backend is a function from the view to the model's text, and acts on nothing _(enforced: mechanical)_ ^c1

- **Subject**: every backend handed to `run`.
- **Violated when**: a backend acts on the world, forwards a tool schema, executes a native tool
  call, or hands back anything but the model's text.

The loop renders the view, calls the backend once per turn, awaits the result when it is awaitable,
and reads the text; a `Reply` is text. Three shapes are built. The router sends the view as a real
message array, the head as system and later notifications as user, so the provider's prefix cache
holds.

The subscription CLI takes the view as one transcript with its roles marked, every acting feature
off by flag and a chat framing in place of its agent instructions. The session CLI keeps one
conversation per run (C4). A native tool call in a router answer with empty content is rebuilt as
the tag text ([[ADR-0004-the-language#^c4|ADR-0004/C4]]); beside content it is dropped today, and
the refusal is owed.

### C2: A backend hands back the prompt count of the attempt that answered _(enforced: mechanical)_ ^c2

- **Subject**: every backend response, and the loop's reading of it.
- **Violated when**: the count handed back is a sum over attempts, a boolean or a non-positive value
  anchors the figure, or the record keeps anything but plain text.

The count rides the `Reply`; the loop reads it and the record keeps the text as a plain string. The
router hands back the answering attempt's `usage.prompt_tokens`; its envelope sums every attempt for
the bill, and a sum of two prompts is the size of neither.

The session CLI hands back the last model turn's input, cache read and cache write when the CLI
prints per-turn usage, else the call's sum over its turn count, an average that reads low. The
subscription CLI keeps its usage on the envelope and hands back no count (S3). A boolean is an
integer in Python, so a value that is not a positive integer is ignored.

### C3: The fold measures the estimate plus the reported context above the floor _(enforced: mechanical)_ ^c3

- **Subject**: the fold event and the context figure of every notification.
- **Violated when**: the fold fires on the estimate alone while a count stands above the view beyond
  the floor, or the floor is folded, scaled or measured.

Per run the runtime keeps the last count with the estimate sent beside it, the summed growths, and
the floor. What the count stands above the estimate beyond the floor is history the record never
saw: a session CLI's tool turns.

The fold event ([[ADR-0007-the-record#^c2|ADR-0007/C2]]) compares the estimate plus that excess
against `view_budget`. Under `fold_inputs` earlier inputs and replies fold too, the latest input
stays. Over the budget with nothing older to fold, the event still rides the notification and a
session starts over (C4). The figure is the count plus the estimated growth since, or on a shrink
the count less what left at the run's rate ([[ADR-0006-the-notification#^c4|ADR-0006/C4]]); the
floor stays in the figure, out of the measure.

### C4: A session sends only what the view gained, and starts over from the folded view on a directive or the fold event _(enforced: mechanical)_ ^c4

- **Subject**: every call on a session backend.
- **Violated when**: a call after a context directive or a fold resumes the old conversation, a view
  that only shrank without one restarts it, or two runs share a session.

Every message names its run; the backend keeps a session per run id, so two runs through one backend
never share a conversation. A caller naming no run falls back to content: a first entry with other
content, or another system prompt, is another run. A call sends the entries not yet sent; a view
that only shrank resends the notification.

When a new entry is a context directive's result or the notification carrying the fold event, the
session starts over from the folded view: one cache miss, and the CLI's tool-turn history goes with
the old session. That restart bounds a run whose CLI runs its own tools (A3). Cost accumulates over
a session; the envelope keeps this call's delta.

### C5: Every call lands an envelope, failed ones too, and only a transient failure is retried _(enforced: mechanical)_ ^c5

- **Subject**: every backend call.
- **Violated when**: a billed attempt's usage is lost, a failed call lands no envelope, a 401 or 403
  is retried, or a subscription's cost is written as a number.

The router retries with backoff on a 429, a 5xx, a transport failure and an errored choice; a 200
carrying the provider's error is retried only by that error's code. An empty finished answer is
sampled again, then handed over blank. Usage sums every attempt; the cost is the known subtotal,
flagged when an attempt is missing from it; a call that fails after a billed attempt lands a failed
envelope carrying the bill.

The subscription CLI retries a transport failure or an empty answer, keeps every attempt's usage,
and writes its cost as unknown, never zero. A refused CLI turn rides its cost on the error.
Cancelling a call kills and reaps the CLI child before the cancellation goes on.

## Decisions

### D1: The router backend in `hub/harness/openrouter.py` ^d1

Serves C1, C2 and C5. `OpenRouter(model, ...)` posts the view with usage included and `max_tokens`
32768: at 8192, 3 of 125 turns that wrote 40 to 52 actions were cut mid-tag. Temperature, provider
routing, reasoning control and stop sequences are the caller's options; the thinking budget and the
stop on the notification frame are ruled on in the bench record ([[ADR-0012-the-bench|ADR-0012]]).
The key comes from the environment or the keychain, never logged. `tool_calls_text` rebuilds a
native call when the content is empty; `calls` keeps the envelopes.

- **Landing evidence**: `tests/test_openrouter.py`: the count of the attempt that answered, the
  retried errored choice, the billed failure kept, the native call handed back as text.

### D2: The two CLI shapes in `hub/harness/claude_code.py` ^d2

Serves C1, C2, C4 and C5. `ClaudeCode` runs the CLI once per turn: tools off, one turn, no settings
loaded, strict MCP config. `ClaudeCodeSession` resumes one CLI session per run and restarts it on a
directive or the fold mark; for a served run it may hand the CLI its own tools, a working directory
and one MCP. Both hand back the last turn's count from the CLI's per-turn usage when printed.
Cancellation kills and reaps the child.

- **Landing evidence**: `tests/test_claude_code.py`: both shapes hand back this call's count, the
  last turn's when several ran, the session resumed with only the new entries, restarted by a
  directive and by the fold, one session per run, cancellation stopping the child.

### D3: The subscription CLI backend in `hub/harness/codex.py` ^d3

Serves C1 and C5. `Codex` runs the CLI once per turn in a scratch directory with every acting
feature disabled: spawning removed by `agents.max_depth=0` (the feature flag alone does not), web
search off, a chat framing replacing the base instructions, the environment context dropped. A
private home holding a symlinked login is used when given. The view goes in as one transcript; usage
comes from the `turn.completed` event; cost is unknown. It hands back plain text (S3).

- **Landing evidence**: `tests/test_codex.py`: the transcript in and the usage shaped, the transient
  retry with attempts recorded, the empty answer retried with both attempts counted, the failed
  envelope, cancellation joining the child.

### D4: The anchor at the call site and the floor in `_notify` ^d4

Serves C2 and C3. After each call `Actor.run` reads `prompt_tokens` off the reply, keeps the pair
(count, estimate sent) as the run's anchor, adds to the summed growths when the view grew, lowers
the floor to the least excess seen, and hands the record `str(text)`. `_notify` measures the folded
view, adds the excess above the floor, folds on that measure, then writes the figure from the
anchor.

- **Landing evidence**: `tests/test_actor.py`: the figure as the last count plus the view added
  since, the fold at the measured rate, the fold deciding on the reported context and folding old
  inputs, a plain string on the record, a boolean not a count.

| Folding by editing the CLI's history                            | the conversation is the CLI's; only a restart from the folded view applies the fold, at one cache miss                                 |
| Reading the served model off the response and refusing a mismatch | which model a name binds to is decided below the boundary; the envelope keeps the response's model and compares nothing (S5)         |

## Consequences

- **S1**: A subscription CLI has no cost figure: the spend is unknown, never zero, and a reader that
  sums it says so.
- **S2**: The same model through the loop and through its own CLI is comparable in one box
  ([[ADR-0012-the-bench|ADR-0012]], the bench).
- **S3**: The subscription CLI hands back no count, so a run on it keeps the view estimate as its
  figure and folds on the estimate alone; handing back the input count of its `turn.completed` event
  is owed.
- **S4**: A session call whose CLI ran several tool turns reports the last turn's context only when
  the CLI prints per-turn usage; otherwise the average reads low, and the figure with it, until the
  next call.
- **S5**: The boundary: which model a name resolves to, through which route, on whose key, and
  whether the model that answered is the one named, are not decided here. The router's envelope
  keeps the response's `model`; the subscription CLI's keeps the name requested; nothing compares
  them.
- **S6**: The session CLI's input safeguard refuses, deterministically per prompt, text that frames
  the model's prose as its thinking; prompt text handed to it describes what the model writes, never
  where it thinks.
- **S7**: The session CLI's default model emits thinking on the language path, about 330 output
  tokens for a 30-token turn; a dollar figure is read from a run's envelopes, never from a price
  table.
- **S8**: The figure is an estimate for one turn after a session starts over from the folded view
  (C4); the next count corrects it ([[ADR-0006-the-notification|ADR-0006]] S3).
- **S9**: A backend that raises ends the run by its exception ([[ADR-0002-the-run#^c4|ADR-0002/C4]])
  with the notification already on the record ([[ADR-0006-the-notification#^d1|ADR-0006/D1]]); the
  reap of a cancelled call at the run's end is owed there ([[ADR-0002-the-run|ADR-0002]] S4).
- **S10**: The session CLI appends no envelope when its call fails, against C5: the failure raises
  before the call is kept, so a spend row misses it whole ([[ADR-0016-the-lion-command|ADR-0016]]
  S2); the fix is owed.
